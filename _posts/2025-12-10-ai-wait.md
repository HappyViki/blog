CSS is so easy, I say
SQL is like CSS for DB, someone else says

Sure.
I actually like SQL, RegEx, etc.
This isn't the issue!

My frustration isn't with backend development as a primarily frontend developer. I know I am full stack, I did LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) development with WordPress for 4 years.

It's the waiting for AI to respond and waiting for the app to load. Only to see that the AI didn't respond correctly, and having to argue with ChatGPT about what this app can and can't do. Yes, we have context. Yes, we have memory. I only want the former!

AWS Bedrock Action Groups gives the AI database context. Which is super cool, actually. Removing the memoryId fixed the issue for this Bedrock Agent.

CSS is easy in comparison; I've done it for so long. 
CSS is easy; it's fast to test. 
CSS is easy; I can change it in the browser and when it works, I can simply copy the selector string!

The issue is waiting for AI to respond. I suppose it's like the old days with dial-up and waiting for internet to load. Now that's a perspective!
