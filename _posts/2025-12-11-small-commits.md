title: "Big Picture, Small Changes"

I get lost in the details easily, which is why I learned to work in small, reversible changes and rely on checkpoints.

Like everyone says, growth happens when you step outside your comfort zone. For me, that meant finally pushing through and finishing a full-stack app instead of abandoning it halfway through.

While building it, I focused on creating a minimum viable product. Every time I started spiraling into details, I asked myself a simple question: *Is this necessary?* Every couple of weeks, I made a short checklist of changes to evaluate and implement. 

**Simple tips for making small, reversible changes:**
1. Git commit at every working stage.
2. Keep commits as small as possible.
3. Name commits clearly so you know exactly what to roll back if needed.

That same approach carries into my current contract. It's helped me work confidently with technologies I hadn't used before. I build until it works, create a checkpoint, then move forward.
