title: ".NET Experience"
---

I began working with .NET by teaching .NET MAUI at iCode, a K-12 coding school. Although it was my first direct exposure to .NET, I was comfortable stepping into it quickly by relying on structured materials and translating concepts into clear, teachable steps. That experience gave me a solid foundation in the .NET ecosystem and confidence working within it.

I later used .NET in a more hands-on way while tutoring students in Godot, where we built a small text-based adventure game using C# and .NET. This reinforced my understanding of program flow, state management, and user interaction from a non-web perspective.

Recognizing how backend-heavy many .NET teams are, and wanting to help bridge that gap, I continued deepening my experience by building and deploying a lead-generator application using .NET 8 MVC. I worked with controllers, model binding, and Razor views, focusing on shaping backend data into clear, usable interfaces.

My strongest advantage in .NET work is my frontend background. I bring advanced CSS and JavaScript (including jQuery) into MVC applications to enhance Razor views, improve form handling, and create responsive, intuitive user experiences without overcomplicating the stack. I am comfortable owning the space between backend logic and frontend behavior, and I enjoy making data-driven applications feel polished and usable.

This combination of .NET fundamentals and strong JavaScript experience is where I do my best work.
