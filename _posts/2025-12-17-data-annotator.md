title: "From Data Annotator to AI Engineer"
---

Starting out as a data annotator gave me an important foundation for the work I do with AI today.

Annotation taught me how much human judgment goes into machine learning. The work itself was straightforward. I spent my time labeling real-world tech support conversations, identifying patterns, and following clear rules. It was repetitive, but it built intuition about how models learn from human input.

My work now uses a very different part of my brain.

Instead of labeling data, I am building systems. I move data from databases to APIs, into AI models, and back out to frontend dashboards. I deploy to development environments, troubleshoot AWS issues, compare local and production behavior, configure Bedrock, and read CloudWatch logs when something breaks.

The transition from annotation to engineering has been less about AI itself and more about managing complexity.

Understanding how data is created and labeled helps me reason about AI outputs, but the day-to-day work is software engineering. It requires holding many moving parts in my head at once and learning how to pace myself.

I am still figuring out how to manage the mental load.

What helps is setting boundaries around my schedule, not working too late, listening to coffee shop jazz, and spending weekends doing low-effort activities like walking or drawing. Those resets make it possible to keep growing into this next stage of my career.
