# Welcome to my blog :)

I'm growing a lot as a software developer, and I thought: what better way to document what I'm learning than through a blog!?

Quick recap of who I am: My preferred language is JavaScript. I started out as a full-stack WordPress developer, then moved into React development, and now I do a mix of both. I'm currently niching down to help .NET developers with frontend work. I built an MVC app that accepts Stripe payments to showcase my C# abilities.

This blog is where I track what I'm learning and the projects I'm building along the way.
